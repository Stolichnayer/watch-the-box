# Watch the box
### Game engine: Unity

A game I made 4 years ago that was meant to be uploaded in Google Play.
I lost the source code, but I found a backup I had made in the middle of its development, so I uploaded it.

Dodge boxes and collect as many coins as you can, before you die, to make a highscore!
